#NFTs as proof of attendance and collateral

## Project Title
**NFTs as proof of attendance and collateral**

## Project Description
NFTs as proof of attendance and collateral is a blockchain-based smart contract designed to issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a representation of attendance. The NFTs can be collateralized by users with Ethereum, creating an innovative system where attendance is not only recorded but also has a tangible value. Users can redeem their collateralized NFTs to reclaim their deposited Ethereum, promoting trust and usability.
